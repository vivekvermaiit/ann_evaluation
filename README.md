This repository contains code and settings for our final project in IFT6166. 

We evaluate kANNolo and LoRANN, two recent ANN libraries on their performance on few datasets. We look at the kANNolo paper closely to see their technique of using graph based indexing HNSW along with Product Quantization (PQ), and add evaluate a couple more datasets. We also run hnswlib library on the datasets.

The repository has the template files for kANNolo, the python files for LoRANN and hnswlib to run the evaluations, the generated reports from the evaluations, and QPS vs Accuracy plots for the results.
